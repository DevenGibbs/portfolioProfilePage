        <h3> About Me </h3>
        <p> After graduating from the University of Oklahoma with a B.S. in Petroleum Engineering, I worked for both a large, public Oil & Gas Operator as well as a smaller, privately funded company. Both were incredibly rewarding experiences where I learned a lot and was exposed to the technology and people that led me to my pursuit of software engineering today.</p>
        <p> While I definitely enjoyed my time in the Oil & Gas Industry, I also found that the projects I most enjoyed working on revolved around developing workflows in new and exciting software or building custom solutions to help us move faster or solve complex problems. </p>
        <p> Now, I'm a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> building the skills necessary to tackle the challenges wtihin Software Development. </p>
        <p> I've always loved being a part of a passionate team with a common goal and can't wait to collaborate with other developers. Please reach out using any of my contact information below! </p>
        <p> When I'm not learning to code, I'm spending time with my family (my husband, Brian and my daughter, Maeve) and my two dogs (Charlee the labrador and Rosie the beagle)! We love spending time outdoors, traveling to new places, and trying new cuisine!  </p>
